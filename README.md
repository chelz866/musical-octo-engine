# AO3 Downloads Viewer

A Docker dashboard for what [ao3downloader](https://github.com/nianeyna/ao3downloader) has
downloaded. It scans your downloads folder, reads embedded epub metadata (title, author, rating,
category, relationships, a best-effort fandom guess), and cross-checks against ao3downloader's
own `log.jsonl` to flag anything logged as downloaded but missing on disk, or logged as a failure.

It does not trigger downloads -- it only looks at files already on disk, the existing log, and a
small local SQLite file for manual corrections and tracked feeds you add yourself. The one
exception is the Tracked Feeds page, which does fetch AO3 Atom feed URLs you explicitly add.

Everything is cached in that same SQLite file and only updated when you click **Refresh** (top
right of every page) -- there's no background polling or scheduled job. A refresh re-scans the
downloads folder/log and re-fetches every tracked feed. Until you click it, pages read the last
snapshot even if files on disk have changed since -- that's the tradeoff for pages loading
instantly instead of re-walking the filesystem and hitting AO3 on every request.

## Pages

- **Downloads** (`/`) -- the full list with stats, filterable by fandom (`?fandom=...`, linked
  from the Fandom column or the Fandoms page).
- **Issues** (`/issues`) -- everything with a problem: a parse error, logged as downloaded but
  missing on disk, or a logged failure. Each row can be dismissed (hidden from the default view,
  toggle "show dismissed" to see them again) and has an inline form to fix the title/author.
- **Fandoms** (`/fandoms`) -- unique fandom names with work counts; click one to filter Downloads.
- **Tracked Feeds** (`/tracked`) -- add any AO3 Atom feed URL (tag, series, or user feed) and see,
  for each work in it: chapter progress, whether AO3 currently shows it as complete, whether you
  have it, and a best-effort "up to date" hint (compares the feed's last-updated time against when
  you downloaded/logged the work -- not an exact chapter-count comparison, see `app/rss.py`). Each
  feed's table is collapsible once it gets long.

Fandom can be corrected on both Downloads and Issues via a checkbox picker ("edit" under the
Fandom column) listing every untyped tag the epub actually has -- pick the real fandom(s) instead
of retyping a name from scratch, with a free-text field for anything not in the list.

## Running

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `DOWNLOAD_DIR` (your ao3downloader downloads folder),
   `LOG_DIR` (the folder containing `log.jsonl`), and `DATA_DIR` (a writable folder for this app's
   own small SQLite file -- manual overrides and dismissals live there).
2. `docker compose up --build`
3. Open `http://<server>:8000/` (or whatever `HOST_PORT` you set).

## Scope of this version

- Only `.epub` files matching ao3downloader's `<work_id>_...epub` naming (underscore or space
  after the id -- settings.ini can customize this) are parsed for metadata; other formats it can
  produce (pdf/mobi/azw3) aren't parsed yet.
- Rating, Warnings, and Category come from AO3's fixed vocabularies and are matched reliably.
  Relationships are detected via the `/`/`&` convention in tag names. Fandom has no type label in
  the epub metadata and no consistent tag ordering across works, so it's a best-effort heuristic
  (see `app/epub_meta.py`) that can occasionally include a character name or miss a fandom --
  use the Issues page's manual edit to correct it for a specific work.
- The downloads folder and log file are mounted read-only; only the small `/data` SQLite file
  (manual overrides/dismissals/cache/tracked feeds) is writable, and nothing here downloads or
  modifies your fics.
- Refresh is entirely manual -- nothing auto-refreshes on a timer, so a stale cache just sits
  there until you click the button.
